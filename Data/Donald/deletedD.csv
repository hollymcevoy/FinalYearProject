I'm not a Trump supporter (Bernie voter 16/20) I'm just responding to the meme she posted.  I think Trump made the mistake of listening and empowering too many radical individuals.

Using Pew &amp; IPSOS data, Trump almost certainly lost American under 35s by a *smaller* margin in 2020 than the Tories lost British under 35s in their landslide 2019 win. It's unsustainable - 50pt blowout wins among over 65s won't last forever.
