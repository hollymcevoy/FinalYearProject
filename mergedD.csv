Thus, they decided to run away together at Mc'Donald's. In this place they were finally free to be with one another. After six months, they gave birth to a hairy boy.

You decide which is worse. In my opinion they are about equally bad. And that said... they were both also used as pawns by the underlying evil. Truth wins.
